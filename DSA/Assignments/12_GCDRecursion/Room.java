//        Problem Statement
//        Yogi and Dharam are playing a game in which one has to solve the problem in order to get out of the room. Dharam goes first and Yogi gave him a problem. Since Dharam is having problem solving it, your task is to solve the problem for him.
//
//        Problem:-
//        Given a range from A to B your task is to count the numbers in which the difference between adjacent digits is not more than one.
//        Input
//        The first line of input contains a single integer T. The next T lines contain two space- separated integers each containing values of A and B.
//
//        Constraints:-
//        1 <= T <= 100
//        1 <= A, B <= 1000000000000
//        Output
//        For each test case print the count of numbers in the range [A, B] such that the difference between adjacent digits is not more than one.
//        Example
//        Sample Input:-
//        2
//        10 30
//        1 10
//
//        Sample Output:-
//        6
//        10
//
//        Explanation:-
//        10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23
//        1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
